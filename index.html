      <p>Aaron Ainsworth is currently a Ph.D. student in Education Policy and Social Context at 
        the University of California, Irvine School of Education where he studies 
        the K-12 education workforce. He is interested in how educator labor markets 
        respond to both in and out-of-school changes and their implications for the 
        preparation, recruitment, development, effectiveness and retention of educators. 
        To that end, he is interested in partnerships with education stakeholders and 
        novel uses of longitudinal administrative data systems.
